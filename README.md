# Autonomous Robot Navigation (sim-1)

This project implements an **autonomous collision-free route planner** for a robot in a simulated environment.

## Features
- Uses **computer vision** to detect obstacles
- Fully autonomous (no manual input)
- Tested with static and moving obstacles
- Supports multiple levels of complexity

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sim-1.git
   cd sim-1



Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Start the simulation:

.\start_sim.ps1


Open in browser:

http://localhost:8000/index.html


Watch the robot move automatically ðŸš€

Levels

Level 1 â†’ Robot avoids static obstacles

Level 2 â†’ Robot avoids moving obstacles

Level 3 â†’ Analysis of obstacle speed vs collisions

Results

Videos of runs are available in the videos/ folder.

Level 1 (static obstacles): average X collisions

Level 2 (moving obstacles): average Y collisions
